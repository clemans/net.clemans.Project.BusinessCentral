## 2. User Security Testing ðŸ”’

### Test Functional Areas

1. **Identify Functional Areas:**
   - List all functional areas that the user has access to (e.g., Finance, Sales, Purchase).
   - For each functional area, document the specific permissions that are expected for the user.

2. **Perform Security Tests:**
   - Log in as the user and navigate to each functional area within Business Central.
   - Attempt to perform typical tasks (e.g., creating invoices, approving purchases) to ensure the permissions are correctly set.
   - Verify that the user can access only the areas and actions they are permitted to.
   - Document any discrepancies or errors encountered.
